# Forbes_Case_Study
Hi, This is my third SQL Project. I downloaded two files from Kaggle's, sorted the data, and then tried to find a few solutions by asking a few Business Questions. 
It consists of only one dataset
The Name of The Dataset is Forbes_CaseStudy_Dataset
It has 1000+ records or rows
It has 10 columns or attributes

Agenda -

1. Analysing the companies based on their Market-Value, Sales and Profits over the year
2. Sorting the data by sector-wise profitable companies
3. Publish the Findings based on the data analysis
